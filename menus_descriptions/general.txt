When the program starts, the first elements displayed on the screen are the canvas visualization area and the main menu. From there, you can begin designing your own robotic manipulator model and view the results using the menu options dedicated to constructing the robot. It is essential to build your model before proceeding to other menus, as this is a prerequisite for utilizing other features. You can also save your model, allowing you to load it for future projects.
Once the model is built, you can analyze its kinematics, including forward, inverse, and differential kinematics, by navigating to the relevant menus. If you have implemented the robotic arm in a physical setup, you can control it through a serial connection between your PC and an Arduino microcontroller using the control menu. This menu allows you to select the appropriate serial port and baud rate and to send commands through an integrated serial monitor. You can also define the motors for each axis of movement and adjust their settings when controlling the robot's joints, using sliders, buttons for incremental changes, and other control options.

Additionally, you may find more detailed information about the program's functionalities by reading the descriptions provided in each menu.

Mouse Bindings for the Canvas Visualization Area:
• Right click and drag: Rotate the scene (world frame) on the canvas.
• Left click and drag: Transfer the scene (world frame) on the canvas.
• Wheel rotate: Zoom in / Zoom out on the scene (world frame) on the canvas.
• Double right click: Reset the world frame origin to the center of the canvas.

General Keyboard Shortcuts:
• Control + r or Control + R: Resize the GUI window.
• Control + s or Control + S: Save the current built robotic manipulator model.
• Control + b or Control + B: Build the current designed robotic manipulator model for use.
• Control + v or Control + V: Switch between kinematic and control variables to configure the joints of the robotic manipulator.
• Control + z or Control + Z: Show / Hide the robotic manipulator.
• Control + e or Control + E: Decrease the canvas area and increase the menus area.
• Control + d or Control + D: Decrease the menus area and increase the canvas area.
• Control + [Number]: Go to the menu specified by the number.
